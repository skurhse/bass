Card categories are listed in alphabetical order. Sections contain one or more 'What is?'-style question to establish foundational terms.

## Agile Software Development

### 1. Recite the [Agile Manifesto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development).

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.

Through this work we have come to value:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

### 2. List the [twelve principles of Agile Software](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html).

- Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
- Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
- Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
- Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
- The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
- Working software is the primary measure of progress.
- Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
- Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
- The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

## Application Security

### 1. What is the [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749)?

OAuth 2.0 is is an open standard for authorization and access delegation providing flows for web apps, desktop apps, mobile phones, and IoT devices.

### 2. What is OAuth scope?

Scope is a mechanism in OAuth 2.0 to limit an application's access to a user's account. An application can request one or more scopes and the access token issued to the application will be limited to the scopes granted.

### 3. How should one implement [OAuth 2.0 for Browser-Based Applications?](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-browser-based-apps)

- Browser-based applications MUST implement the Proof Key for Code Exchange extension when obtaining an access token.
- Browser-based applications MUST prevent CSRF attacks against their redirect URI.
- Clients MUST register redirect URIs with the authorization server.

### 4. What is [Proof Key for Code Exchange](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636)?

Proof Key for Code Exchange (abbreviated PKCE, pronounced ‚Äúpixie‚Äù) is an extension to the authorization code flow to prevent CSRF and authorization code injection attacks.

The technique involves the client first creating a secret on each authorization request, and then using that secret again when exchanging the authorization code for an access token. This way if the code is intercepted, it will not be useful since the token request relies on the initial secret.

### 5. What is [OpenID Connect](https://www.openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/)?

OpenID Connect is an interoperable authentication protocol based on the OAuth 2.0 framework.

The specification suite is extensible to support a range of optional features such as encryption of identity data, discovery of OpenID Providers, and session logout.

### 5. What is [top](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Top_(software))?

`top` is process monitor program that displays sorted information about CPU and memory utilization.

The Linux version of `top` is part of the `procps-ng` tools group.

### 6. What is [lsof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lsof)?

lsof is a command meaning "list open files", which reports a list of all open files and the processes that opened them.

Open files in the system include disk files, named pipes, network sockets and devices.

### 7. What is [sysstat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sysstat)?

`sysstat` or "system statistics" is a collection of Linux tools used to monitor system performance and usage activity.

The systat program `sar` is used to report on various system loads, including CPU activity, memory/paging, interrupts, device load, network and swap space utilization.

`sadc` is the system activity data collector and backend.

## Microsoft .NET

### 2. What is [System.IDisposable](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fundamentals/runtime-libraries/system-idisposable)?

`System.IDisposable` is a system interface used to release unmanaged resources like window handles, or open files and streams.

A IDisposable object is disposed of using either a `Dispose` method in a try/finally block, or `using` statement.

## Network Security

### 1. What is [TLS 1.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8446/)?

Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a cryptographic protocol that allows client/server applications to communicate over the Internet in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, and message forgery.

Once the client and server have agreed to use TLS, they negotiate a stateful connection by using a handshaking procedure. The protocols use a handshake with an asymmetric cipher to establish cipher settings and a session-specific shared key with which further communication is encrypted using a symmetric cipher.

### 2. What is [Public-key infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure)?

PKI or 'Public-key infrastructure' is a set of roles, policies and procedures needed to manage public key certificates: electronic documents used to prove the validity of a public key.

### 3. What is a Certificate Authority?

A CA or 'Certificate authority' is a root certificate issuer, usually a company that charges customers a fee to issue certificates for them.

A CA acts as a trusted third party‚Äîtrusted both by the subject (owner) of the certificate and by the party relying upon the certificate.

### 4. What is [X.509](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-X.509)? 

X.509 is an International Telecommunication Union (ITU) framework for public-key certificates.

## Object-oriented Programming

### 1. What is [Object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)?

Object-oriented programming or 'OOP' is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which contain data in the form of fields and code in the form of methods.

### 2. What is Inheritance?

Inheritance is an OOP code reuse and extensibility pattern, either class-based or protoype-based, implemented via dynamic dispatch.

### 3. What is data abstraction vs. encapsulation?

Data abstraction is a design pattern in which data are visible only to semantically related functions.

Encapsulation prevents external code from being concerned with the internal workings of an object.

### 1. What is [SaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service)?

Software-as-a-service (/s√¶s/) is a form of cloud computing in which the provider manages all the physical and software resources used by the application.

SaaS differs from other software delivery models in that it separates the possession and ownership of software from its use.

### 2. What is the ['Twelve Factor App'](https://12factor.net/)?

The twelve-factor app is a methodology for building software-as-a-service apps that:

- Use declarative formats for setup automation.
