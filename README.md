## Agile Software Development

### 1. Recite the [Agile Manifesto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development).

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.

Through this work we have come to value:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
- Working software over comprehensive documentation.
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
- Responding to change over following a plan.

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

### 2. List the [twelve principles of Agile Software](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html).

- Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
- Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
- Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
- Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
- The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
- Working software is the primary measure of progress.
- Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
- Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
- The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

```

A. The client requests authorization from the resource owner. The authorization request can be made directly to the resource owner or indirectly via the authorization server.

B. The client receives an authorization grant, which is a credential representing the resource owner's authorization, expressed using one of four grant types or using an extension grant type. The authorization grant type depends on the method used by the client to request authorization and the types supported by the authorization server.

C. The client requests an access token by authenticating with the authorization server and presenting the authorization grant.

D. The authorization server authenticates the client and validates the authorization grant, and if valid, issues an access token.

E. The client requests the protected resource from the resource server and authenticates by presenting the access token.

F. The resource server validates the access token, and if valid, serves the request.

### 3. What is OAuth scope?

Scope is a mechanism in OAuth 2.0 to limit an application's access to a user's account. An application can request one or more scopes and the access token issued to the application will be limited to the scopes granted.

### 4. How should one implement [OAuth 2.0 for Browser-Based Applications?](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-browser-based-apps)

- Browser-based applications MUST implement the Proof Key for Code Exchange extension when obtaining an access token.
- Browser-based applications MUST prevent CSRF attacks against their redirect URI.
- Clients MUST register redirect URIs with the authorization server.

### 5. What is [Proof Key for Code Exchange](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636)?

Proof Key for Code Exchange (abbreviated PKCE, pronounced ‚Äúpixie‚Äù) is an extension to the authorization code flow to prevent CSRF and authorization code injection attacks.

The technique involves the client first creating a secret on each authorization request, and then using that secret again when exchanging the authorization code for an access token. This way if the code is intercepted, it will not be useful since the token request relies on the initial secret.

### 6. What is [OpenID Connect](https://www.openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/)?

OpenID Connect is an interoperable authentication protocol based on the OAuth 2.0 framework.

The specification suite is extensible to support a range of optional features such as encryption of identity data, discovery of OpenID Providers, and session logout.

## Object-oriented Programming

### 1. What is [Object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming)?

Object-oriented programming or 'OOP' is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which contain data in the form of fields and code in the form of methods.

### 2. What is Inheritance?

Inheritance is an OOP code reuse and extensibility pattern, either class-based or protoype-based, implemented via dynamic dispatch.

### 3. What is data abstraction vs. encapsulation?

Data abstraction is a design pattern in which data are visible only to semantically related functions.

Encapsulation prevents external code from being concerned with the internal workings of an object.

## OS-level virtualization

### 1. What is [os-level virtualization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS-level_virtualization)?

'OS-level virtualization' or 'containerization' is a virtualization paradigm in which the kernel allows the existence of multiple isolated user space instances called containers.

OS-level virtualization usually imposes less overhead than machine virtualization because programs use the operating system's normal system call interface.

### 2. What is the [Open Container Initiative](https://opencontainers.org/)?

The 'Open Container Initiative' is an open governance structure for the express purpose of creating open industry standards around container formats and runtimes.

The OCI contains three specifications:

- the Image Specification (image-spec)
- the Distribution Specification (distribution-spec)

### 3. What is [containerd](https://containerd.io/)?

'containerd' is an industry-standard container runtime with an emphasis on simplicity, robustness, and portability.

'containerd' is available as a daemon for Linux and Windows, which can manage the complete container lifecycle:
- image transfer and storage
- container execution and supervision
- low-level storage 
- network attachments, etc.

## 4. What is [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/docker-overview/)?

'Docker' is a freemium PaaS product suite used to deliver software packages as containers.

'Docker Engine' is an open source technology for building and containerizing applications, with the following components:
- A server with a long-running daemon process‚Äî`dockerd`
- APIs which specify interfaces that programs can use to instruct the Docker daemon.
- A command line interface (CLI) client‚Äî`docker`

## 5. What is a [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/)?

Docker builds images automatically by reading the instructions from a 'Dockerfile'.

A Dockerfile is a text document that contains all the commands to assemble an image.

## 6. List Dockerfile [instructions](https://docs.docker.com/reference/dockerfile/#overview).

## 7. What are Docker [multi-stage builds](https://docs.docker.com/build/building/multi-stage/)?

With multi-stage builds, multiple `FROM` statements are used in a Dockerfile.

Each `FROM` instruction can use a different base, and each of them begins a new stage of the build.

## 8. What are Docker [tags](https://docs.docker.com/reference/glossary/#tag)?

A 'tag' is a label applied to a Docker image in a repository.

Tags are [formatted](https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/image/tag/#description) with the following format:

`[HOST[:PORT_NUMBER]/]PATH` where `PATH` is composed of `[NAMESPACE/]REPOSITORY`.

Artifacts can be selectively copied from one stage to another, reducing the size of the final image.

## Site Reliability Engineering

### 1. What is a [Recovery Time Objective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT_disaster_recovery#Recovery_Time_Objective)?

Recovery Time Objective or 'RTO' is the targeted duration of time within which a business process must be restored after a disruption.

### 2. What is a [Recovery Point Objective](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IT_disaster_recovery#Recovery_Point_Objective)

A Recovery Point Objective or 'RPO' is the maximum acceptable interval during which transactional data is lost from an IT service.

## Software as a Service

### 1. What is [SaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service)?

Software-as-a-service (/s√¶s/) is a form of cloud computing in which the provider manages all the physical and software resources used by the application.

SaaS differs from other software delivery models in that it separates the possession and ownership of software from its use.
