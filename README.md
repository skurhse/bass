## Agile Software Development

### 1. Recite the [Agile Manifesto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agile_software_development).

We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it.

Through this work we have come to value:

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan

That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.

### 2. List the [twelve principles of Agile Software](https://agilemanifesto.org/principles.html).

- Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
- Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
- Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
- Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
- Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
- The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
- Working software is the primary measure of progress.
- Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
- Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
- Simplicity--the art of maximizing the amount of work not done--is essential.
- The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly.

## Application Security

### 1. What is the [OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6749)?

OAuth 2.0 is is an open standard for authorization and access delegation providing flows for web apps, desktop apps, mobile phones, and IoT devices.

### 2. What is OAuth scope?

Scope is a mechanism in OAuth 2.0 to limit an application's access to a user's account. An application can request one or more scopes and the access token issued to the application will be limited to the scopes granted.

### 3. How should one implement [OAuth 2.0 for Browser-Based Applications?](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-ietf-oauth-browser-based-apps)

- Browser-based applications MUST implement the Proof Key for Code Exchange extension when obtaining an access token.
- Browser-based applications MUST prevent CSRF attacks against their redirect URI.
- Clients MUST register redirect URIs with the authorization server.

### 4. What is [Proof Key for Code Exchange](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7636)?

Proof Key for Code Exchange (abbreviated PKCE, pronounced ‚Äúpixie‚Äù) is an extension to the authorization code flow to prevent CSRF and authorization code injection attacks.

The technique involves the client first creating a secret on each authorization request, and then using that secret again when exchanging the authorization code for an access token. This way if the code is intercepted, it will not be useful since the token request relies on the initial secret.

### 5. What is [OpenID Connect](https://www.openid.net/developers/how-connect-works/)?

OpenID Connect is an interoperable authentication protocol based on the OAuth 2.0 framework.

The specification suite is extensible to support a range of optional features such as encryption of identity data, discovery of OpenID Providers, and session logout.

### 6. What is [JSON Web Token](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7519)?

JSON Web Token or 'JWT' is a compact and URL-safe standard for representing claims to be transferred between two parties.

- as a JSON object that is used as the payload of a JSON Web Signature
- as the plaintext of a JSON Web Encryption (JWE) structure

The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is a stateless application-level request/response protocol for hypertext information systems.

HTTP is also designed for use as an intermediation protocol, wherein proxies and gateways can translate non-HTTP information systems into a generic interface.

### 5. What is [REST](https://ics.uci.edu/~fielding/pubs/dissertation/rest_arch_style.htm)?

Representation State Transfer or 'REST' is an architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems.

Under REST, no session state on the server component is allowed. Each request from client to server must contain all of the information necessary to understand the request, and stored context must be kept entirely on the client.

REST response data must be labeled as cacheable or non-cacheable. RESTful architecture may be layered such that each component cannot "see" beyond the immediate layer with which they are interacting.

## Information Security

### 1. What is the [CIA triad](https://www.nccoe.nist.gov/publication/1800-26/VolA/index.html)?

The "CIA" triad epresents the three pillars of information security:

## Network Security

### 1. What is [TLS 1.3](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc8446/)?

Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a cryptographic protocol that allows client/server applications to communicate over the Internet in a way that is designed to prevent eavesdropping, tampering, and message forgery.

Once the client and server have agreed to use TLS, they negotiate a stateful connection by using a handshaking procedure. The protocols use a handshake with an asymmetric cipher to establish cipher settings and a session-specific shared key with which further communication is encrypted using a symmetric cipher.

### 2. What is [Public-key infrastructure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_key_infrastructure)?

PKI or 'Public-key infrastructure' is a set of roles, policies and procedures needed to manage public key certificates: electronic documents used to prove the validity of a public key.

### 3. What is a Certificate Authority?

A CA or 'Certificate authority' is a root certificate issuer, usually a company that charges customers a fee to issue certificates for them.

A CA acts as a trusted third party‚Äîtrusted both by the subject (owner) of the certificate and by the party relying upon the certificate.

### 2. What is Inheritance?

Inheritance is an OOP code reuse and extensibility pattern, either class-based or protoype-based, implemented via dynamic dispatch.

### 3. What is data abstraction vs. encapsulation?

Data abstraction is a design pattern in which data are visible only to semantically related functions.

Encapsulation prevents external code from being concerned with the internal workings of an object.

## Software as a Service
